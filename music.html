            Last year, my Spotify wrapped called me a pilates princess.
            <br /><br />
            With a slightly bruised ego, I am back to religiously making monthly playlists.
            <br /><br />
             This month, a lot of r&b and electric pop. Upbeat and danceable, something to keep me going through the cold winter days. 
            <br /><br />

              Within the last year we've seen a rise in the popularity of country music; And I, admittingly, have been swept up in the storm of the 
              sweet ring of harmonicas, warms strings of acoustic guitars, and lyrics that romanticize staring at the vast horizons atop the desert landscape. 
              While I am forever a fan of rap, hip-hop, and rnb (music that falls under the problematic label of "urban"), my interest in country 
              comes at time where I have just finished undergrad and I am beginning to think of the lifestyle I want to work towards for my future self;
              slow, family-oriented, and appreciative of the little things. These desires did not happen in a vaccuum, with an oversaturated news and social media
              feed, the yearning for a slow life is a phenomenon felt by many trying to escape the noise and chatter that-- if not faced in our physical 
              environment-- is forced down our throats by way of blue-lit screen. Maybe I can't turn off my phone, but I can tune into Zach Bryan or Tyler Childers 
              and imagine that I am waiting for tumble weeds to pass on by.
